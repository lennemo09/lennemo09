# Hi, Iâ€™m Len ðŸ‘‹
  
Iâ€™m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and a member of the Computational Imaging for Physical Sciences (CIPS) lab within the Toronto Computational Imaging Group (TCIG).

My research centers around scientific imaging, differentiable rendering, and AI for science. Iâ€™m broadly interested in how computational approaches can help drive new discoveries in the sciences.

Iâ€™m a big fan of animals and nature. I'm also a hobbyist photographer interested in animals and still-life.
